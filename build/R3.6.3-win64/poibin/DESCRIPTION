Description: Implementation of both the exact and approximation methods for computing the cdf of the Poisson binomial distribution as described in Hong (2013) <doi: 10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.006>. It also provides the pmf, quantile function, and random number generation for the Poisson binomial distribution. The C code for fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is written by R Core Team (2019)<https://www.R-project.org/>, which implements the FFT algorithm in Singleton (1969) <doi: 10.1109/TAU.1969.1162042>.
